# Local Scripts

This directory contains useful local batch scripts, including scripts to make interacting with the web server easier (e.g. executing a git pull and cache purge on the staging website in one command), but also useful tools such as executing WP-CLI in debug mode.

All scripts are commented, though hopefully the script names show what they do.

These scripts assume that the user has [SSH keys set up](../docs/development-help.md#ssh-keys), and a Host of `sl` set up in the config.
