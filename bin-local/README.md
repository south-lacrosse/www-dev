# Local Scripts

This directory contains batch scripts which make interacting with the web server easier, e.g. executing a git pull on the staging website in one command.

These scripts assume that the user has [SSH keys set up](../docs/development-help.md#ssh-keys), and a Host of `sl` set up in the config.
