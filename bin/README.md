# Production Scripts

These are scripts which will be useful on a Production server, e.g. copying production to staging. They should be placed somewhere out of the web root, so hopefully the web hosts have that in `~/public_html`, and you can add these into a new folder `~/bin`, and add that onto the path, probably by adding `PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin` onto the end of `~/.profile`.
