# Useful Plugins for Development

You can find a couple of useful plugins in [src2/plugins](../src2/plugins/). To use them just drop the file into `wp-content/plugins/must-use`, so you don't even need to enable them. Simply delete them once done.

* Query Monitor - query-monitor - adds query data to web pages to aid debugging

* Members - members - adds pages to the Admin dashboard to query/edit roles and capabilities
